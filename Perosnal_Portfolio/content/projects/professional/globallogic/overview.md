## Situation
Within GlobalLogic, existing analytical models were deployed without robust operational support or systematic evaluation frameworks, which limited business confidence and SLA adherence.

## Approach
- Developed and maintained ML pipelines using Dataiku with versioned workflows and statistical validation mechanisms.
- Designed A/B testing and validation frameworks to measure model quality and business impact.
- Implemented production support routines to maintain SLA levels and address performance issues proactively.

## Outcomes
Improved model robustness and production reliability, established structured validation processes, and delivered actionable insights with clear operational oversight.
