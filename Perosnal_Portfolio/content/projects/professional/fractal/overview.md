## Situation
At Fractal Analytics, there was a requirement to build scalable, governed AI/ML infrastructure that could operate reliably across multiple markets and use cases, replacing ad-hoc pipelines that lacked consistency, observability, and controlled promotion workflows.

## Approach
- Designed and implemented end-to-end pipelines using GCP Vertex AI with automated CI/CD workflows for controlled QA→production promotions.
- Built monitoring and alerting layers using Pub/Sub and SendGrid to capture pipeline outcomes and surface execution issues.
- Standardized MLOps governance patterns with MLflow tracking, modular pipeline components, and cross-project conventions to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

## Outcomes
Pipelines were operationalized across multi-country analytics environments with measurable stability improvements, reduced deployment failures, and clearer ownership boundaries for model delivery and performance monitoring.
