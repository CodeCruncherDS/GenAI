## Situation
Atlas needed a modern partner portal to replace a legacy SPA that struggled with performance, permissions, and scalability.

## Approach
- Migrated core flows to Next.js App Router with server components for heavy data views.
- Introduced a component contract layer to keep client-side interactions isolated.
- Built a design token pipeline to align product and engineering expectations.

## Outcomes
The portal shipped in phases without feature freezes, while maintaining performance budgets and reducing regressions.
