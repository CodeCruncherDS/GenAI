# Decision Canvas

Decision Canvas is a lightweight framework for documenting tradeoffs, impact, and follow-up actions for product decisions.

## Structure
- Context and constraints
- Decision owner and reviewers
- Options considered and tradeoffs
- Outcome tracking

## Why it exists
Product teams often lose visibility into the reasoning behind key decisions. Decision Canvas keeps the record lightweight but durable.
