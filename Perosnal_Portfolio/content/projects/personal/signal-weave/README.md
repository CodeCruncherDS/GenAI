# Signal Weave

Signal Weave is a personal knowledge system that tracks notes, highlights, and decisions across multiple sources. The goal is to increase signal density by surfacing the most impactful insights without losing context.

## Features
- Weighted tagging based on frequency and recency.
- Daily synthesis that maps signals to projects.
- Lightweight browser capture workflow.

## Architecture
The system is intentionally minimal: a content ingestion layer, a scoring engine, and a UI that prioritizes clarity over density.
