Knowledge Retrieval Lab
Grounded answers from your own data

Build a retrieval-augmented system with citations, evaluation hooks, and a UI foundation so you can focus on domain logic instead of infrastructure.
What is Knowledge Retrieval?
Knowledge Retrieval (formerly Knowledge Assistant, Answer Engine) is a framework for building retrieval-augmented generation systems that return grounded, citation-backed answers from your organization's own data. It gives developers a foundation for ingestion, retrieval, evaluation, and UI, so they can focus on domain logic instead of boilerplate and infrastructure. Because it's built on proven architecture patterns with OpenAI vector store, fine-grained control over retrieval, and built-in evals for quality monitoring, it simplifies parts of deploying a scalable, trustworthy knowledge interface - whether for internal teams or customer-facing experiences.

Problems this solves
Knowledge fragmentation: Information lives across wikis, PDFs, databases, and ticketing systems - making it slow and painful to find reliable answers.
Search that doesn't scale: Traditional search returns documents, not answers. Users still spend time digging.
Inconsistent accuracy: Manual knowledge retrieval often leads to incomplete or outdated information, eroding trust.
High integration cost: Building retrieval-augmented systems from scratch requires complex infrastructure, slowing down time to value.
Limited trust and governance: Most AI tools lack citation, eval, and retrieval controls needed for enterprise-grade accuracy and compliance.
Use cases
Enterprise knowledge search: Empower employees to ask questions and receive instant, citation-backed answers from internal docs, wikis, and databases.
Customer support knowledge bases: Help support reps resolve tickets faster with cited information on your knowledge bases.
Customer-facing chatbots: Deliver instant, reliable answers to customers - without long wait times or escalating to humans unnecessarily.
Workplace support (HR/IT/Legal): Deflect internal tickets by giving employees trustworthy answers to policy and process questions.
Specialized research retrieval: Give experts fast access to curated, proprietary information for decision-making.
Get started: clone the repo and follow the README
Clone the repository and follow the steps articulated in the GitHub page step by step.
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-knowledge-retrieval
cd openai-knowledge-retrieval
Once you have cloned the repository, follow the steps in the github instructions to execute step by step on your end.
Challenges
Add another vector store (such as Pinecone, or weaviate) and feed in sample data into the vector store index.
Configure the vector store to work with the knowledge retrieval tool
Test the parallel calls to and optimize it further by supplementing with reranking and decomposition or additional advancements.
