1. Overview
Why AgentKit?

AgentKit is OpenAI's secure foundation for shipping AI agents into production—complete with connectors, auditing, and guardrails so teams can automate approvals, CRM updates, and other real-world workflows with confidence.
This 60-minute session distills the AgentKit announcement into a practical playbook. You’ll understand how AgentKit bootstraps enterprise-ready agents, how to connect your SaaS stack, and how to ship auditable runbooks with human approvals.

2. 60-minute training outline
Foundations (15 min) — Review AgentKit architecture, trust boundaries, and deployment models.
Connectors (15 min) — Configure built-in connectors (Notion, Slack, Salesforce, GitHub) and learn how to add custom ones.
Secure orchestration (15 min) — Implement approval loops, policy gates, telemetry, and auditable traces.
Launch blueprint (15 min) — Draft the governance checklist for your next AgentKit project and prep the production checklist.
3. Capabilities you’ll explore
Trusted connectors that let agents sync notes, tickets, and CRM updates without exposing credentials.
Human-in-the-loop approvals and compliance policy enforcement built into every run.
Observable traces, audit logs, and runbooks so agents are ready for regulated environments.
Extensibility patterns for bringing your own APIs, data vaults, or toolchains to AgentKit.

5. Field exercises
Map one of your existing approval workflows onto AgentKit’s connectors and approval policies.
Instrument telemetry hooks so product, compliance, and SRE teams can trace every agent action.
Extend the toolkit with one custom connector (internal API, database, or SaaS app) and document the security posture.
6. Readiness checklist
Ship with confidence

AgentKit agents should launch with (1) approved connectors, (2) an escalation policy, (3) telemetry hooks, and (4) a rollback plan. Validate these four items before any pilot or production rollout.
